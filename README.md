# Payroll-Tracker-Project
This application is designed to help a payroll manager input their employee data and properly budget for the company. This project was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Doing this project has helped me better understand the usage of console logs, "if" statements and loops.
## Table of Contents

The payroll manager would need to use the add employee button, then input all of the employee data. The payroll manager would need to continue clicking the "okay" button. If they want to stop inputing employees, they would need to click the "cancel" button. Once the payroll manager has done so, the application will list all the data in alphabetical order. When the employee right clicks the mouse and clicks "inspects", they will be able to the the average salary, along with a randomly selected winner for their contest.
