# Payroll-Tracker-Project
This application is designed to help a payroll manager input their employee data and properly budget for the company. This project was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Doing this project has helped me better understand the usage of console logs, "if" statements and arrays.

### Installation
I had to access gitlab to obtain the starter code. Once I opened the starter code, I followed all the necessary instructions listed on there. First, I needed to create a function to collect employee data. This will allow the user to input the employee's name and salary. If incorrect data was inputed, the user will be warned and asked to enter valid data.  Once an employee's data has been inputed, the user has the option to either add another employee or cancel. When the user clicks cancel, all the data they inputed would be organized in a chart. 
The user will be able to see the average salary and contest winner by accessing the console. To display the average salary, I created an array, function and console log. The array was used to help find the average salary. Using the console log, I was able to display the average salary of all the employees inputed to the application. 
Since the pyaroll manager requested a random employee gets selected for their contest, I createed another function to help select the random employee. I also created a console log to display the name of the selected employee, along with a message to congratulate them.
### Usage
The payroll manager would need to use the add employee button, then input all of the employee data. The payroll manager would need to continue clicking the "okay" button. If they want to stop inputing employees, they would need to click the "cancel" button. Once the payroll manager has done so, the application will list all the data in alphabetical order. When the employee right clicks the mouse and clicks "inspects", they will be able to the the average salary, along with a randomly selected winner for their contest.
